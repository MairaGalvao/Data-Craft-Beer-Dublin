**Introduction:** Today, the *Irish* craft beer industry is in a period of consistent growth in Ireland and increasing worldwide competition, which is gaining market shares. 
Despite the relevant growth, Irish breweries have a lot more to learn in terms of increasing their consumer reach through marketing.
The research shown in this study has discovered that many Irish breweries do not utilise the most effective marketing skills, and to some extent do not view marketing as the
most important tool for their business.

Marketing strategies are often subject to failure for several reasons: they are not robust and solid as it should be or are not suitable for the target audience. 
A significant factor to be considered is that many craft breweries in Ireland do not have sufficient financial resources for thorough market research.

Hence this study aims to analyse the data of a survey done in 2019 with craft beer consumers in Dbulin-Ireland in order to understand consumers’ mentality;
purchase decision habits; their behaviour towards loyalty, and finally the gap between the marketing and consumers’ perception.
